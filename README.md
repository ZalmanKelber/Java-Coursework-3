This is a simple repository to keep track of my coursework for the Coursera class, [Object Oriented Programming in Java](https://www.dukelearntoprogram.com/course4/index.php), which is Part III of a series of courses on Java offered by Duke and UC San Diego.  The coursework for the first course can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/ZalmanKelber/Java-Coursework).

These programs can be run using Eclipse and Java 7 or 8 (later versions are incompatible).  Starter code provided by source.

Completed thus far:

* Simple Markers assignment (in module 3 of source folder)
